#Fantasy_Football_Draft_Sheet

This is a draft sheet generator that takes in 4 files and creates a fantasy football draft cheat sheet. It takes in data from FantasyPros and the Fantasy Footballers and provides an easy to read chart and preforms calculations. This can be updated and run with CSV files from the 2 sites noted in the DSG.py code.

This project was done using python and pandas, the jupyter notebooks have been included as well which better portray what is going on behind the scenes
